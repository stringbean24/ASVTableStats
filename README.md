# ASVTableStats
# QIIME2 Sequence Length Plugin

This plugin provides a basic tool for QIIME2 users to analyze and visualize the distribution of sequence lengths in their datasets. It was written as part of a final project for an undergraduate bioinformatics course. 

## Purpose

Developed as part of an undergraduate metagenomics research project, this tool helps:
- Extract sequence length data from ASV feature tables and associated FASTQ files
- Calculate basic statistics (min, max, mean, std dev)
- Visualize the distribution of read lengths using a histogram

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qiime2-seqlen.git
cd qiime2-seqlen
